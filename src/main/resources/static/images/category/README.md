# Trail Category Images

This folder contains category-based images for AI-generated trails.

## Current Setup
The AI service uses Unsplash URLs as placeholders for now. You can replace these with your own images.

## Image Files Needed
- lake.jpg - Lake scenery
- mountain.jpg - Mountain scenery
- forest.jpg - Forest scenery
- desert.jpg - Desert scenery
- coastal.jpg - Coastal scenery
- canyon.jpg - Canyon scenery

## Recommended Image Size
- Width: 800px minimum
- Height: 1200px minimum (2:3 aspect ratio works best)
- Format: JPG or PNG

## Using Unsplash (Temporary)
For now, the system uses Unsplash as fallback:
- Lake: https://source.unsplash.com/800x1200/?lake,hiking
- Mountain: https://source.unsplash.com/800x1200/?mountain,hiking
- Forest: https://source.unsplash.com/800x1200/?forest,hiking
- Desert: https://source.unsplash.com/800x1200/?desert,hiking
- Coastal: https://source.unsplash.com/800x1200/?coastal,beach
- Canyon: https://source.unsplash.com/800x1200/?canyon,hiking

To use local images, simply add the JPG files to this folder with the correct names.
